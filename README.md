# Using Custom Software 

We have installed a significant amount of software that is specific to this course. To make using this software as easy as possible, `source` the `bashrc` that we have provided. You should add.
```
module load python/2.7.8
source /path/to/bashrc
``` 
to every script you submit to the queuing system.
