# A Couple of Notes 

* Qiime has several software tools inside its module. Therefore, running some programs does not require you to do anything more than loading the Qiime module. Some programs include 
  - mothur, rdp.  
* For some programs, you can simply source the `bashrc` file to have access to them. 
  - cd-hit, cufflinks, fasttree, muscle, pynast, quikr, raxml, samtools, trimmomatic, tophat, pynast.
* You must change the `-M` and `-P` flags to be able to run any of the test scripts!
